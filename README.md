# DNA_Analysis

This program analyzes a DNA sequence using object-oriented programming. The types
of analysis include the calculation of GC content, k-mer counting, finding the
complementary sequence of the input DNA strand, and performing translation in 
all six-reading frames into protein sequences. This program also imports the
tkinter module, the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. 


### Prerequisites/Assumptions

Python 3+ must be installed on the system running the program. 

Tkinter is apart of the standard Python interface and no other prerequisites are needed.
